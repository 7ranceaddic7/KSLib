## KS-lib/games

This is a public repository for games written in kerboscript

### basic layout

Each has it's own sub folder for ease of organization.
With in each folder there will be a `game.ks` file that you can `RUN` to play the game and a README using ascii text, or Github markdown files (.md)
Additionally there may also be needed libraries for the game in that case they can ether be found in the game folder or linked to in the README file.

A short summary of each game can be found [HERE](future link here)
